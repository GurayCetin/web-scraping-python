Python script to download png files to specified directory path and from given url as input

This is a Python program that downloads all PNG images from a website and saves them to a specified directory path. It uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract all PNG image links from the website and then saves them to the specified directory using the os library.

* It's checking URL is valid or not, if it's not valid, printing that it is not valid URL.
* If URL is not valid, the script is exiting before asking the input of directory path.
* It is checking if there is .png files on given URL, if no; printing that "There is no .png extension image in this website"
* Also it's handling with some png files without starting with http and https, skipping these ones 
* Dynamic < img > tags generated by JavaScript are ignored, so JavaScript and dynamic HTML content is not rendered.
* The script is supporting redirections - it's default behavior of requests library (allow_redirects=True)
* png extension is case-insensitive 
* It's tested for all possible cases on many websites.
